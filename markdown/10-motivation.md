### PostgreSQL is a great DB, why switch away from it?

> "[..] currently in the OpenStack community there is a bias towards MySQL over other

Note:
* less then 10% of the deployments are on PostgreSQL (2017 User Survey)
* Discussions in the Technical Commitee in 2017, a resolution was released to
  express a bias towards MySQL
* PostgreSQL is still supported by OpenStack and works fine in most cases
* over the years there have been a few PostgreSQL specific issues in some
  OpenStack projects
* MySQL (and related) are getting more attention upstream
* more testing in the upstream CI
* more experience upstream
